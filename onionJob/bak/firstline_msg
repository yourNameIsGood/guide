 		 
After five years, he just happened to be walking down her street?
As he fell, he waited for
As he flicked through the letters, a small, handwritten envelope caught his attention and his heart began to thump
As he opened the car door, there was a loud
As she searched, her movements were frantic
As she stopped to catch her breath, she looked back
As soon as she walked in, she felt the tension
As the dream faded, she chased it, forlorn
As the policeman pulled back the sheet, she knew immediately that
As the prison gate closed behind him, he saw someone waiting for him
Bacon sandwiches always reminded her
Everything about her was a lie
He could hear everything, but dare not open his eyes
He'd had a bad day and just needed something to make him feel better
He didn't reply and immediately she thought: they've got him and now they're coming for me
He didn't want to go out on such a night but
He had an hour to get home. If he didn't make it,
He had kept their mother alive in their thoughts. Too alive, perhaps.
He hadn't meant to scare the child
He hadn't seen the old man since
He had the urge to clear the ground, to look out and see nothing
He had waited twenty years to return it
He kept absolutely still as the footsteps got louder
He looked at his phone, turned pale, then quickly left the room. She watched him, smiling.
He opened the door to find her standing there, crying.
He realised the child had seen him and he couldn't let him get away
He sat her down and held her close before telling her the terrible news
He stared hard at the table as he tried to recall his attacker, and began describing
He waited until her husband was out of the room, then...
He wanted her job and it would be easy enough to
He wanted to tell him how much he loved him but
He was at a crossroads and whichever path he chose would ruin someone''s life
He was excited to find 150 new emails in his inbox
He was going back to a place he'd hoped he would never see again
He was older than she'd thought he would be
He was stunned - the stranger in front of him looked exactly like the girl he'd been dreaming about
He was successful, attractive and charming but he'd learnt that people of that age always had secrets
He was terrified of small spaces and she knew
His voice had never sounded so cold
It had never entered his head that his son was not his own blood
Its all bills, bills, bills. Thats my only answer now, he said, pointing to
It started with a chance meeting on a film-set
It was just for one night
It was the trip of a lifetime, yet
It was time. She'd fought against it for so long
It was up to her to investigate how the accident had really happened
It would only be a fling - she wasn't about to break up the happy home
More and more people were refusing to obey the laws of the land
Most vivid amongst the memories of his home town
Only the very oldest people remembered a time when humans could see in colour
On the Livingstone estate, flies were sometimes the first indication that someone had died
Outside the cabin, the wind howled through the trees, while inside, the old woman's fire was nearly out.
Please try to persuade him to come, for my sake
Reluctantly, he handed over the key
She clung on to the piece of driftwood, praying for daylight
She couldn't believe it. Was it really him?
She decided to go to her father's grave, to ask his advice
She'd got him wrong, but that was her loss
She'd only given in because she was lonely
She felt for the lock in the dark
She had followed the woman for days and at last her patience was paying off
She had found something that would mean she'd never be poor again - but there was a catch
She had made a poor job of hiding the damage
She had made a poor job of hiding the damage 
She had missed the last train and there was only one person she 
She had no intention of choosing sides until she was sure who was going to win
She had to find the necklace, before
She kept checking her phone and email, wishing someone would make contact
She knelt on the carpet in her new living-room, a big cardboard box in front of her, unwrapping ornaments
She looked around quickly, to see if anything had been taken.
She opened her handbag and tipped the contents onto the floor
She sat in the chair, staring into space, while the kids charged around above her, yelling at the tops of their voices
She stood out from the crowd because
She took a deep breath and said to her boss - 
She turned and nearly fell over the bonnet of his car, which was crawling quietly along the street.
She was a stranger in a very strange land
She was beginning to realise how far down in her memory she'd buried her teenage years
She was carried along by the crowd
She yelled down at her boys who were arguing over the one swing left in the tiny playground
So far, the disease had cropped up in five different towns
Someone must have seen him, because the police were at his door
Spider threads caught at her face, a sign that no-one had been there yet
That summer seemed to last forever
The accident wasn't her fault
The boy hadn't spoken since his twin had gone
The door was closed, and as I put my hand on the handle, I felt afraid of what we might find
The entrance to the tunnel was his only way out
The Ferrari stopped and the tinted window opened to reveal
The fire was getting closer
The first Christmas she could remember was also her best Christmas ever.
The footsteps were moving away
The girl shouldn't have been sacked but if he said anything
The horse came back alone
The house wasn't the same to her any more
The kiss reminded him of chemistry lessons in school, when if the right two elements were put together, they'd explode
The little boy's idea of heaven was
The old house, with its wildly overgrown garden, was silent, secretive
The old photos made her conscious of her age, of how much time had passed - and of what an interesting life she'd had.
The pen hadn't been worth stealing
The pink glove lay on the ground, almost covered
There had been many theories about how she had been murdered
There was a legend about the well in the garden
There was a strange wailing sound coming from the next room
There was nothing left of the money except
There was sadness in her face as she told him he looked a lot like his father
There was something not quite right about the window.
The sound of laughter drifted up from the street below, making him feel very alone in this new town
The text message simply said 'very clever'
The urge to interrupt him before he had finished was overwhelming
The victim had tried to write something as he was dying
The woman doting on her children across the room was still recognisable as the bully from her high school
They couldn't be allowed to fight. He had to think of a way to stop it
They'd had a lot of freedom back then and not just because their environment was safer - few children had been allowed to roam as much as they
They found his diary under his bed
They had been together for twenty-five years
They had to work together so they were going to have to learn to get along
They had to work together, so they would need to
They say everyone who looks into their family history will find a secret sooner or later
'This is what we do with the horses,' she said as she sponged her mother's hot face, dripping water everywhere
To my cheating wife, I leave
To save his own life, he would have to kill
Under normal circumstances he would speak his mind, but, with a gun against his head
Was it a knock that had woken her?
Was it simply luck that had caused her to turn down this street?
When he lifted his head, she barely recognised him for the bruises
When her father was drunk, he'd say 'I used to have a brother, you know', and get a faraway look in his eyes
When she opened the door, she wished
Who would have poisoned the old man's dog?
Why had no-one ever mentioned Mum's twin?
Why shouldn't they help themselves, after the way they'd been treated?
With her faded dress and worn shoes, she knew she couldn't go
With him, she'd had some wonderfully stable times
Without meaning to, she'd arranged two dates for the same evening
With sadness, she realised they needed some time apart
