 		 
The girl shouldn't have been sacked but if he said anything
 		 
He hadn't seen the old man since
 		 
With him, she'd had some wonderfully stable times
 		 
She'd got him wrong, but that was her loss
 		 
Was it a knock that had woken her?
 		 
The girl shouldn't have been sacked but if he said anything
 		 
'This is what we do with the horses,' she said as she sponged her mother's hot face, dripping water everywhere
 		 
When her father was drunk, he'd say 'I used to have a brother, you know', and get a faraway look in his eyes
 		 
He had waited twenty years to return it
 		 
He opened the door to find her standing there, crying.
 		 
He kept absolutely still as the footsteps got louder
 		 
The boy hadn't spoken since his twin had gone
 		 
She'd only given in because she was lonely
 		 
She had made a poor job of hiding the damage 
 		 
As he opened the car door, there was a loud
 		 
She couldn't believe it. Was it really him?
 		 
He was successful, attractive and charming but he'd learnt that people of that age always had secrets
 		 
He sat her down and held her close before telling her the terrible news
 		 
To save his own life, he would have to kill
 		 
She decided to go to her father's grave, to ask his advice
 		 
He realised the child had seen him and he couldn't let him get away
 		 
Why had no-one ever mentioned Mum's twin?
 		 
She kept checking her phone and email, wishing someone would make contact
 		 
On the Livingstone estate, flies were sometimes the first indication that someone had died
 		 
She looked around quickly, to see if anything had been taken.
 		 
As soon as she walked in, she felt the tension
 		 
He was excited to find 150 new emails in his inbox
 		 
She was a stranger in a very strange land
 		 
He'd had a bad day and just needed something to make him feel better
 		 
He hadn't seen the old man since
 		 
He looked at his phone, turned pale, then quickly left the room. She watched him, smiling.
 		 
As the dream faded, she chased it, forlorn
 		 
She knelt on the carpet in her new living-room, a big cardboard box in front of her, unwrapping ornaments
 		 
He stared hard at the table as he tried to recall his attacker, and began describing
 		 
He hadn't meant to scare the child
 		 
The pen hadn't been worth stealing
 		 
To save his own life, he would have to kill
 		 
The Ferrari stopped and the tinted window opened to reveal
 		 
Why shouldn't they help themselves, after the way they'd been treated?
 		 
So far, the disease had cropped up in five different towns
 		 
The sound of laughter drifted up from the street below, making him feel very alone in this new town
 		 
Everything about her was a lie
 		 
She'd only given in because she was lonely
 		 
He had waited twenty years to return it
 		 
Someone must have seen him, because the police were at his door
 		 
He wanted her job and it would be easy enough to
 		 
He didn't reply and immediately she thought: they've got him and now they're coming for me
 		 
She turned and nearly fell over the bonnet of his car, which was crawling quietly along the street.
 		 
The first Christmas she could remember was also her best Christmas ever.
 		 
With him, she'd had some wonderfully stable times
 		 
They had been together for twenty-five years
 		 
The fire was getting closer
 		 
She turned and nearly fell over the bonnet of his car, which was crawling quietly along the street.
 		 
She took a deep breath and said to her boss - 
 		 
He had waited twenty years to return it
 		 
They had to work together, so they would need to
 		 
With him, she'd had some wonderfully stable times
 		 
So far, the disease had cropped up in five different towns
 		 
The old house, with its wildly overgrown garden, was silent, secretive
 		 
Who would have poisoned the old man's dog?
 		 
As she searched, her movements were frantic
 		 
They had to work together so they were going to have to learn to get along
 		 
The victim had tried to write something as he was dying
 		 
The woman doting on her children across the room was still recognisable as the bully from her high school
 		 
After five years, he just happened to be walking down her street?
 		 
They'd had a lot of freedom back then and not just because their environment was safer - few children had been allowed to roam as much as they
 		 
They found his diary under his bed
 		 
They found his diary under his bed
 		 
He had kept their mother alive in their thoughts. Too alive, perhaps.
 		 
He opened the door to find her standing there, crying.
 		 
His voice had never sounded so cold
 		 
They say everyone who looks into their family history will find a secret sooner or later
 		 
The old photos made her conscious of her age, of how much time had passed - and of what an interesting life she'd had.
 		 
He opened the door to find her standing there, crying.
 		 
Why shouldn't they help themselves, after the way they'd been treated?
 		 
She stood out from the crowd because
 		 
The girl shouldn't have been sacked but if he said anything
 		 
He had an hour to get home. If he didn't make it,
 		 
She had missed the last train and there was only one person she 
 		 
He looked at his phone, turned pale, then quickly left the room. She watched him, smiling.
 		 
That summer seemed to last forever
 		 
There was a strange wailing sound coming from the next room
 		 
As she searched, her movements were frantic
 		 
He hadn't meant to scare the child
 		 
She felt for the lock in the dark
 		 
Was it a knock that had woken her?
 		 
He wanted to tell him how much he loved him but
 		 
'This is what we do with the horses,' she said as she sponged her mother's hot face, dripping water everywhere
 		 
The urge to interrupt him before he had finished was overwhelming
 		 
She decided to go to her father's grave, to ask his advice
 		 
She couldn't believe it. Was it really him?
 		 
It was time. She'd fought against it for so long
 		 
She took a deep breath and said to her boss - 
 		 
They say everyone who looks into their family history will find a secret sooner or later
 		 
The text message simply said 'very clever'
 		 
Under normal circumstances he would speak his mind, but, with a gun against his head
 		 
She couldn't believe it. Was it really him?
 		 
As he flicked through the letters, a small, handwritten envelope caught his attention and his heart began to thump
 		 
The text message simply said 'very clever'
 		 
The little boy's idea of heaven was
 		 
There was something not quite right about the window.
 		 
The text message simply said 'very clever'
 		 
More and more people were refusing to obey the laws of the land
 		 
They say everyone who looks into their family history will find a secret sooner or later
 		 
The footsteps were moving away
 		 
Bacon sandwiches always reminded her
 		 
The sound of laughter drifted up from the street below, making him feel very alone in this new town
 		 
She'd only given in because she was lonely
 		 
Please try to persuade him to come, for my sake
 		 
The victim had tried to write something as he was dying
 		 
There was something not quite right about the window.
 		 
She had followed the woman for days and at last her patience was paying off
 		 
Everything about her was a lie
 		 
As he flicked through the letters, a small, handwritten envelope caught his attention and his heart began to thump
 		 
The victim had tried to write something as he was dying
 		 
Was it a knock that had woken her?
 		 
The door was closed, and as I put my hand on the handle, I felt afraid of what we might find
 		 
As he opened the car door, there was a loud
 		 
She clung on to the piece of driftwood, praying for daylight
 		 
She was a stranger in a very strange land
 		 
He had an hour to get home. If he didn't make it,
 		 
As he opened the car door, there was a loud
 		 
The house wasn't the same to her any more
 		 
He stared hard at the table as he tried to recall his attacker, and began describing
 		 
They found his diary under his bed
 		 
She kept checking her phone and email, wishing someone would make contact
 		 
There had been many theories about how she had been murdered
 		 
Under normal circumstances he would speak his mind, but, with a gun against his head
 		 
He was at a crossroads and whichever path he chose would ruin someone''s life
 		 
He opened the door to find her standing there, crying.
 		 
With him, she'd had some wonderfully stable times
 		 
She stood out from the crowd because
 		 
So far, the disease had cropped up in five different towns
 		 
She was carried along by the crowd
 		 
She couldn't believe it. Was it really him?
 		 
He was going back to a place he'd hoped he would never see again
 		 
Was it simply luck that had caused her to turn down this street?
 		 
Please try to persuade him to come, for my sake
 		 
As the policeman pulled back the sheet, she knew immediately that
 		 
They had been together for twenty-five years
 		 
Spider threads caught at her face, a sign that no-one had been there yet
 		 
The woman doting on her children across the room was still recognisable as the bully from her high school
 		 
It started with a chance meeting on a film-set
 		 
To my cheating wife, I leave
 		 
She opened her handbag and tipped the contents onto the floor
 		 
With her faded dress and worn shoes, she knew she couldn't go
 		 
She yelled down at her boys who were arguing over the one swing left in the tiny playground
 		 
It would only be a fling - she wasn't about to break up the happy home
 		 
The old house, with its wildly overgrown garden, was silent, secretive
 		 
There was nothing left of the money except
 		 
With him, she'd had some wonderfully stable times
 		 
The victim had tried to write something as he was dying
 		 
They couldn't be allowed to fight. He had to think of a way to stop it
 		 
She stood out from the crowd because
 		 
She had followed the woman for days and at last her patience was paying off
 		 
It was time. She'd fought against it for so long
 		 
He kept absolutely still as the footsteps got louder
 		 
She'd only given in because she was lonely
 		 
He wanted her job and it would be easy enough to
 		 
As she stopped to catch her breath, she looked back
 		 
She took a deep breath and said to her boss - 
 		 
She had missed the last train and there was only one person she 
 		 
He was stunned - the stranger in front of him looked exactly like the girl he'd been dreaming about
 		 
She was carried along by the crowd
 		 
Under normal circumstances he would speak his mind, but, with a gun against his head
 		 
He could hear everything, but dare not open his eyes
 		 
She clung on to the piece of driftwood, praying for daylight
 		 
She was beginning to realise how far down in her memory she'd buried her teenage years
 		 
As the prison gate closed behind him, he saw someone waiting for him
 		 
He was at a crossroads and whichever path he chose would ruin someone''s life
 		 
Outside the cabin, the wind howled through the trees, while inside, the old woman's fire was nearly out.
 		 
He had waited twenty years to return it
 		 
She took a deep breath and said to her boss - 
 		 
The kiss reminded him of chemistry lessons in school, when if the right two elements were put together, they'd explode
 		 
There had been many theories about how she had been murdered
 		 
They had to work together so they were going to have to learn to get along
 		 
He hadn't seen the old man since
 		 
He kept absolutely still as the footsteps got louder
 		 
As he fell, he waited for
 		 
It started with a chance meeting on a film-set
 		 
The woman doting on her children across the room was still recognisable as the bully from her high school
 		 
He was older than she'd thought he would be
 		 
Its all bills, bills, bills. Thats my only answer now, he said, pointing to
 		 
To save his own life, he would have to kill
 		 
He looked at his phone, turned pale, then quickly left the room. She watched him, smiling.
 		 
As he flicked through the letters, a small, handwritten envelope caught his attention and his heart began to thump
 		 
She had found something that would mean she'd never be poor again - but there was a catch
 		 
He wanted to tell him how much he loved him but
 		 
Only the very oldest people remembered a time when humans could see in colour
 		 
Why had no-one ever mentioned Mum's twin?
 		 
Spider threads caught at her face, a sign that no-one had been there yet
 		 
Without meaning to, she'd arranged two dates for the same evening
 		 
With sadness, she realised they needed some time apart
 		 
She'd got him wrong, but that was her loss
 		 
It was just for one night
 		 
She'd only given in because she was lonely
 		 
He didn't reply and immediately she thought: they've got him and now they're coming for me
 		 
They say everyone who looks into their family history will find a secret sooner or later
 		 
She decided to go to her father's grave, to ask his advice
 		 
As the policeman pulled back the sheet, she knew immediately that
 		 
She had to find the necklace, before
 		 
The girl shouldn't have been sacked but if he said anything
 		 
He was older than she'd thought he would be
 		 
She had made a poor job of hiding the damage
 		 
The entrance to the tunnel was his only way out
 		 
She couldn't believe it. Was it really him?
 		 
He didn't reply and immediately she thought: they've got him and now they're coming for me
 		 
It was time. She'd fought against it for so long
 		 
She knelt on the carpet in her new living-room, a big cardboard box in front of her, unwrapping ornaments

They had been together for twenty-five years
 		 
They couldn't be allowed to fight. He had to think of a way to stop it
 		 
When she opened the door, she wished
 		 
He waited until her husband was out of the room, then...
 		 
He was stunned - the stranger in front of him looked exactly like the girl he'd been dreaming about
 		 
Under normal circumstances he would speak his mind, but, with a gun against his head
 		 
He was excited to find 150 new emails in his inbox
 		 
She yelled down at her boys who were arguing over the one swing left in the tiny playground
 		 
She had no intention of choosing sides until she was sure who was going to win
 		 
Why had no-one ever mentioned Mum's twin?
 		 
There was a legend about the well in the garden
 		 
She looked around quickly, to see if anything had been taken.
 		 
Most vivid amongst the memories of his home town
 		 
There was sadness in her face as she told him he looked a lot like his father
 		 
She had made a poor job of hiding the damage
 		 
The fire was getting closer
 		 
The sound of laughter drifted up from the street below, making him feel very alone in this new town
 		 
He was going back to a place he'd hoped he would never see again
 		 
He wanted her job and it would be easy enough to
 		 
She had found something that would mean she'd never be poor again - but there was a catch
 		 
She looked around quickly, to see if anything had been taken.
 		 
It was the trip of a lifetime, yet
 		 
The little boy's idea of heaven was
 		 
The horse came back alone
 		 
Why had no-one ever mentioned Mum's twin?
 		 
She had found something that would mean she'd never be poor again - but there was a catch
 		 
He had the urge to clear the ground, to look out and see nothing
 		 
As he fell, he waited for
 		 
It was time. She'd fought against it for so long
 		 
She had found something that would mean she'd never be poor again - but there was a catch
 		 
When he lifted his head, she barely recognised him for the bruises
 		 
She sat in the chair, staring into space, while the kids charged around above her, yelling at the tops of their voices
 		 
He hadn't seen the old man since
 		 
The old photos made her conscious of her age, of how much time had passed - and of what an interesting life she'd had.
 		 
She had followed the woman for days and at last her patience was paying off
 		 
More and more people were refusing to obey the laws of the land
 		 
The pink glove lay on the ground, almost covered
 		 
He was terrified of small spaces and she knew
 		 
It was up to her to investigate how the accident had really happened
 		 
Who would have poisoned the old man's dog?
 		 
She turned and nearly fell over the bonnet of his car, which was crawling quietly along the street.
 		 
The horse came back alone
 		 
They had been together for twenty-five years
 		 
Reluctantly, he handed over the key
 		 
He kept absolutely still as the footsteps got louder
 		 
He didn't want to go out on such a night but
 		 
The entrance to the tunnel was his only way out
 		 
He was successful, attractive and charming but he'd learnt that people of that age always had secrets
 		 
Spider threads caught at her face, a sign that no-one had been there yet
 		 
'This is what we do with the horses,' she said as she sponged her mother's hot face, dripping water everywhere
 		 
The accident wasn't her fault
 		 
The horse came back alone
 		 
He had the urge to clear the ground, to look out and see nothing
 		 
She took a deep breath and said to her boss - 
 		 
They'd had a lot of freedom back then and not just because their environment was safer - few children had been allowed to roam as much as they
 		 
She had missed the last train and there was only one person she 
 		 
It had never entered his head that his son was not his own blood
 		 
With him, she'd had some wonderfully stable times
 		 
The fire was getting closer
 		 
It was the trip of a lifetime, yet
 		 
He was older than she'd thought he would be
